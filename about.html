      I am  <span class="highlight">Francis Rivas,</span> <br>19 years old.
      I live in <address> <span>Barangay Basak San Nicolas</span></address>
    and I graduated from Mantalongon National High School located in Dalaguete, Cebu. 
    <br>My strand was Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS)</h2>

    <ins><h3>My Journey as a Student</h3></ins>
    <p>
  Life of a grade school student is different from the life of a college student.
  As a <b>first year college student</b>, it was so hard to adjust and catch up with what was going on.
  Life <em>humbled me</em>, to the point I looked down upon myself.
  I thought maybe college was not for me <ins>actually shaping me</ins>, 
  but instead of giving up I chose to continue and pursue.
</p>

<p>
  I can define myself as a <strong>dedicated person</strong>, someone who is willing and eager to acquire new knowledge.
  I am <i>compassionate</i> in achieving my goals in life and motivated to reach my aspirations.
</p>

<p>
  Honestly, I still don’t fully know who I am, but I do know I am a student with <mark>purpose, worth, and value</mark>.
  I chose Information Technology because I have <i>loved computers</i> since I was 9 years old.
  That’s why I took this course. I told myself, 
  “<strong>What if I try?</strong> There’s no wrong in trying.
  If somebody can do this, I can do this too.”
</p>

<p>
  I want to enhance my analytical skills, learn coding and programming, and grow through every struggle.
  Despite the hardest battles, I strive to remain <em>genuine and wise</em>. 
  <small>I remind myself daily</small> that I believe many opportunities are waiting, whatever path I choose.

        <b> <p>My first time playing in an open league basketball game was unforgettable. I experienced going up against older men who were stronger and more skilled than me. At first, I felt nervous, but I gained confidence as the game went on. I realized that I needed to push myself harder and trust my team. That game taught me that experience and teamwork matter more than just age or strength.</b><hr>
